I was walking one cold day,  
And I had nothing to say,  
The similies and metaphors  
Wouldn't walk my way,  
The beauty of language  
Seemed lost on me,  
As I was trudging along,  
Through that dismal scene.  

And it just seems wrong,  
It shouldn't be a fight,  
Describin' the things  
In which we take delight,  
So when you find something worth  
Enshringing in verse ---  
It hurts;  
If your words depict it that little bit worse.  

And when you write about beauty,  
You find there's a problem,  
That the words to describe it  
Aren't quite in the Oxford,  
So you cross swords with Oxford,  
Sparring with words,  
To tell the truth of that image,  
And see your message heard.  

And exaggeration feels false,  
While understatement's untrue,  
You need to find a balance  
That's just right for you.  
When balanced, that picture  
Will start to belong,  
In the mind of your reader its life  
Will hold strong.  

But even if you paint well with words,  
Just half your problems are shed,  
There's still something extra,  
Which you haven't expressed:  
You still haven't said why  
You'd lie awake in your bed,  
Stayin' up shiverin' at night  
To picture it in you head.  

For beauty, is something more  
Than what's seen, true beauty ---  
Inspires imagination, and dreams,  
And the most impartant part's  
Not the screen,  
But how it makes you take a second,  
To stop.  
Think.  
And breathe...  

And to do it justice  
You gotta capture the reason,  
Why you find it on you mind  
Each and every season;  
Mould words into a sculpture,  
Encompassing every feeling,  
Even your thoughts as you wrought it,  
So people hear what your preachin'.  

Then when everything's covered,  
And woven together,  
What's carved in ink  
On your page,  
Will ring true each day,  
And won't every betray,  
What it was you encountered  
That was worth its own stage.
